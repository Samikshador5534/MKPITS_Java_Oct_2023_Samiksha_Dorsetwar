	//Java Collection framework provides a Stack class that models and implements a Stack data structure
	
	//The class is based on the basic principle of last-in-first-out
	
	//In addition to the basic push and pop operations, the class provides three more functions of empty, search, and peek
	
	//The class supports one default constructor Stack() which is used to create an empty stack. 
	
	//Declaration:

  // public class Stack<E> extends Vector<E>;
   
   //we must import java.util.stack package and use the Stack() constructor of this class
