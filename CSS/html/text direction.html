      A long time ago, a wealthy king had three beautiful daughters. They had
      everything they wanted offered to them on a platter of gold. However, only
      one thing was lacking in their life, none of them had a husband, nor did
      they have a suitor. This made the king very unhappy. He had food, but he
      could not eat. What shall we do now?
